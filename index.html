<p>It has been a while since Dota 2 had a new hero added to the game. Inai, the Void Spirit and Snapfire were the last ones added in late November 2019.

But we still have hints and whispers about multiple new heroes on the horizon in the game files and hero responses. One of them is the ‘Puppet Master’.</p>
